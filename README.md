I did the tutorial by index: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBkWsyYrWnQ all credit for the base of the project goes to him.

I only tweaked and compiled this program.

You MUST compile this program in visual studio because that is what I programmed this project in.

If you are going to distribute this project please give credit to me and index.

If you have any ideas on how to improve this app tell me and I will see what I can do.

This is my first github page ever but there are many more to come!
