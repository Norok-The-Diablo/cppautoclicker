# cppautoclicker
I did the tutorial by index: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBkWsyYrWnQ all credit for the base of the project goes to him.

I only tweaked and compiled this program.

You MUST have visual studio installed to run and compile the source code of this auto clicker

If you are going to distribute this project please give credit to me and index.

If you have any ideas on how to improve this auto clicker tell me and I will see what I can do!

This is my first github page ever but there are many more to come!
